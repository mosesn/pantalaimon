## Pantalaimon
a daemon

## motivation
Twitter has tons of awesome libraries, but if you don't need them, it isn't transparent how
to get started.  This serves two purposes.  First, it is an example of what you might want
a production quality daemon to look like (this is a work in progress).  Second, it will hide
some of the knobs that twitter gives to you, so that the abstractions you start with are
simpler to understand.

## todo
1. make it production quality
2. library-ize it
3. write docs
4. configurable logging
5. configurable admin port
